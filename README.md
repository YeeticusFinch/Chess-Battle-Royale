# Chess-Battle-Royale
What if chess was a battle royale? Your pieces are on an infinite board, you don't take turns, instead you just move whenever you want, it is always everyone's turn.... utter chaos

## Overview
Each player spawns in as a king, this king can be moved using the arrow keys or WASD controls, and they will gain more pieces as they advance through the world.

The pieces will automatically follow the king, and the player can of-course manually move these pieces.

This is an online game, anyone can connect (currently just over LAN), and there can be up to 10 players in one game.
